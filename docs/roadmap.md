## Short term

Short term feature development will be driven by community demand. Request and vote on new featured on GitHub with the `enhancement` label.

Here are a few targeted themes for the near term:

- Stability and community adoption
- Operational and administrative improvements
- Developer tooling improvements
- Reducing barrier to entry through expanding documentation/examples

## Long term
